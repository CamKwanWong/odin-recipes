    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 225&deg;F (110&deg;C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine egg whites and rose petal powder in the bowl of a stand mixer; beat until soft peaks form. Start beating in <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup sugar gradually. Increase speed to high and beat until stiff and glossy peaks form. Mix in vanilla extract and rose extract. Fold cornstarch very gently into the meringue using a spatula.</li>
        <li>Spoon meringue into a piping bag fitted with a fine round tip. Pipe into 18 individual rounds.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges appear dry, 1 hour 15 minutes. Turn off oven and leave pavlovas inside the oven for another 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese in a bowl for 30 seconds. Add heavy cream and 2 tablespoons sugar; beat until fluffy. Spoon whipped cream into another piping bag.</li>
        <li>Pipe whipped cream over cooled pavlovas. Decorate with dried rose petals.</li>
